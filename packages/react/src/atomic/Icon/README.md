[![@nimbus-ds/icon](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@nimbus-ds/icon?label=%40nimbus-ds%2Ficon)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nimbus-ds/icon)

The Icon component is used when we need to illustrate an action, state or text inside or outside another component.

## Installation

```sh
$ yarn add @nimbus-ds/icon
# or
$ npm install @nimbus-ds/icon
```

### Component Anatomy

The component consists of a vector shape, which uses our Nimbus icons library.

## Guidelines

We use this component to reinforce, through an icon, a message, state or action that requires greater emphasis in relation to a text, for example.

### Sizes

Icon has 3 predefined sizes large, medium and small and must be used taking into account the component and context in which they will be applied.

### AriaLabel

This component does not have text, but it has a tag (Aria Label) to facilitate its identification by people with some type of visual or cognitive limitation. That's why we need to add a description that makes the icon's function clear.

### Recommendation for use

- Illustrate states of an order
- Illustrate actions inside a button
- Illustrate a section of the application
