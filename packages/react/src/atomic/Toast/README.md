Toast allows us to send short messages to the user in a non-intrusive way to communicate component or feedback resulting from some action.
It is a component that appears and disappears after a few seconds. By default, we set the user detection time to 4 seconds, which should be enough for the user to read the message and interfere with its operation.

## Installation

```sh
$ yarn add @nimbus-ds/toast
# or
$ npm install @nimbus-ds/toast
```
