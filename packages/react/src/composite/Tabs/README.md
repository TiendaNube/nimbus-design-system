## Guidelines

We use the component when we have more than two contents of the same context, and we need to switch the focus between them.

### Tabs

This variant serves as a container used to group the tabs.

### Tabs.item

This variant is the individual tab, which allows us to display content after a tab is activated.

### Content

Tab titles must be clear and summarized in up to 2 words, referring to the tab content.
