## Component Anatomy

The Title is a text component, used to apply visual and semantic hierarchy to the contents of a page.

## Guidelines

### Usage Hierarchy

This component has two levels of hierarchy, **semantic** and **visual**, both work independently and can be combined with each other.

#### Semantics

The semantic hierarchy is applied through Html tags (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6), they serve to delimit sections of content for web browsers, plugins and assistive technologies, so we must take into account that h1 has the highest hierarchical level and h6 the lowest.

These classifications can be combined to delimit sections and subsections of content as needed, for more information see [W3 Headings Recommendations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/).

#### Visual

The visual hierarchy is applied through our typographic tokens, which can increase or decrease the prominence of certain titles or subtitles, without interfering with semantic issues.

### Usage recommendations

We use Title to title and subtitle screens, pages, text blocks, sections or other components, employing visual and semantic hierarchy.
