Text is the text component, used to write and format blocks of content within pages or components.

## Implementation

**Install** the component via terminal.

```bash
$ yarn add @nimbus-ds/text
# or
$ npm install @nimbus-ds/text
```

## Component Anatomy

The Text component is composed of a stylized (p) or (span) that consumes our typography tokens for the body, namely the base, the caption and the small.

## Guidelines

### Alignments

Component content can be `left`, `center` and `right` aligned. The criteria for using each one may vary on a case-by-case basis, the most common being the left for running text, the center for unique or punctual information and the right for texts within lists of information.

### Formatting

The component allows you to format snippets of content, being able to customize the weight and color using the span property.

### Usage recommendations

We use Text to write plain text with a basic hierarchy, in addition to formatting specific pieces of content.
