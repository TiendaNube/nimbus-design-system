The badge component is used to communicate quantities of items or pending actions.

## Installation

```sh
$ yarn add @nimbus-ds/badge

## Component Anatomy

The component is composed of stylized text that consumes our tokens, in addition to a background that can vary in color as needed.

## Guidelines

The Badge component should only be used to inform quantities of items, using numbers and numeric signs.

In addition, it has 5 variants that must be used taking into account the amount of items and the necessary visual highlight.

### Neutral

This variant is used when we have a neutral context, related to the number informed by the Badge, but the visual highlight is not essential.

### Primary

This variant is used when we have a neutral context, related to the number informed by the Badge, but the visual highlight is essential.

### Success

This variant is used when we have a positive context, related to the number informed by the Badge.

### Warning

This variant is used when we have an intermediary context, related to the number informed by the Badge.

### Danger

This variant is used when we have a negative context, related to the number informed by the Badge.

## Usage recommendations

We use the Badge component to help the user identify pending or actionable items more quickly, and categorize them by color means to employ the proper visual highlighting.
