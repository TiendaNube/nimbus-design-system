[![@nimbus-ds/tag](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@nimbus-ds/tag?label=%40nimbus-ds%2Ftag)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nimbus-ds/tag)

The Tag component is used to categorize information, organize or indicate the status of elements or components using keywords, icons or colors.

## Implementation

**Install** the component via terminal.

```bash
$ yarn add @nimbus-ds/tag
# or
$ npm install @nimbus-ds/tag
```

## Component Anatomy

The component is composed of stylized text that consumes our tokens, in addition to an icon and a colored shape, the latter two are optional and cannot be used at the same time.

## Guidelines

The Component tag has 3 configuration possibilities that can be used according to the need.

- Text only;
- Icon with text;
- Color with text.

In addition, it has 5 variants that must be used taking into account the message we want to communicate.

### Default

This variant is used to highlight relevant but neutral information, that is, information that is not associated with a positive context, of success, error or danger.

### Primary and Success

These variants are used to highlight relevant information, which are associated with a positive or successful context, respectively.

### Warning and Danger

These variants are used to highlight relevant information, which are associated with a risk or error context respectively.
Variants can be combined in the same context to help quickly read the status of different elements or information.

## Usage recommendations

We use the Tag component to help the user understand the state of different elements, categorizing them through variants and using their elements to support this communication.
