# Package.json Rules

NEVER bump manually the version of the package.json file. It should be done automatically by the CI/CD pipeline. Only track in the specific CHANGELOG.md file the changes.

# Structure 

Keys that have specific rules:

- name:
    - Should be the name of the package, prefixed with @nimbus-ds/
    - Example: @nimbus-ds/skeleton
- version:
    - Should be 0.0.0 for initial version.
- files:
    - Should be the files that are going to be published to the npm registry. Must contain:
        - dist
        - README.md
        - CHANGELOG.md
- dependencies:
    - Only included if have dependencies at runtime level. Must include all of those dependencies.
    - Do not include dependencies for development or build time.
- devDependencies:
    - Only included if have dependencies for development or build time. Must include all of those dependencies.
    - Example:  
        - "@nimbus-ds/webpack": "workspace:^"
- peerDependencies:
    - Only included if have dependencies for runtime level but expected to be installed by the consumer.
    - Example:  
        - "react": "^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0",
        - "react-dom": "^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0"
- scripts:
    - Only build, clean and version. 
    - Example: 
        - "build": "yarn g:webpack",
        - "clean": "rm -rf dist",
        - "version": "yarn version"
- homepage: Must be "https://nimbus.nuvemshop.com.br/documentation"
- repository: Must be "git+https://github.com/TiendaNube/nimbus-design-system.git" of type "git".
