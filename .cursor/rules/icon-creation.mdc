# SVG Icon Creation Steps
Follow each step precisely and strictly in the given order.

## Pre-conditions (MUST CHECK BEFORE CHANGES)
1. **Duplicate Check:**
   * Carefully search for icons in the repository with names that are strictly equal or visually similar to the new icon.
   * If a match or a similar icon exists, notify the user and **do not proceed with the operation**.

2. **SVG Quality & Optimization Check:**

   * Before accepting the SVG, analyze it for common bad practices:
     * Excessive/unnecessary HTML elements, comments, metadata, or definitions.

   * If the SVG contains these issues, **do not continue**. Instead, return feedback to the user with analysis, and recommend using [SVGOMG](mdc:https:/jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg) or similar optimization tools.
   * Ignore optimization or viewBox issues as they will be fixed by the build process. If the SVG is missing width and height attributes, add them.

## **Required Steps**
### 1. **File Creation**

* Create the new icon in the `packages/icons/src/assets` directory.

* Filename must:

  * Be lowercase
  * Use dashes (`-`) as separators
  * End with `.svg`

**Example:** `shopping-cart.svg`

* Final exported icon component name should use PascalCase with suffix "Icon":

  * Example: `ShoppingCartIcon`

### 2. **SVG Dimensions**
* Set explicit width and height attributes to exactly `16px`:

```html
<svg width="16" height="16" ...>
```

### 4. **Build Icons Package**
* Run the following command in the project root:

```sh
yarn build:icons
```

* Confirm this generates a new `.tsx` file in the `packages/icons/tmp` directory.

### 5. **Create a PR**
   - Commit using the format: `feat(icons): add [icon-name] icon`
   - Always create a branch from the latest `main`.
   - Push branch and open a PR titled: `feat: Add [icon-name] icon`.

## **Never Do the Following**
* Do not place icon files outside of `packages/icons/src/assets`.
* Do not omit `width` and `height` attributes.
* Do not use uppercase letters or underscores in filenames.
* Do not directly commit changes to `main`. Always use a dedicated branch and open a PR.
