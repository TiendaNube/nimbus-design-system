# SVG Icon Creation Steps
Follow each step precisely and strictly in the given order.

## Pre-conditions (MUST CHECK BEFORE CHANGES)
1. **Duplicate Check:**
   * Carefully search for icons in the repository with names that are strictly equal or visually similar to the new icon.
   * If a match or a similar icon exists, notify the user and **do not proceed with the operation**.

2. **SVG Quality & Optimization Check:**

   * Before accepting the SVG, analyze it for common bad practices:
     * Excessive/unnecessary HTML elements, comments, metadata, or definitions.

   * If the SVG contains these issues, **do not continue**. Instead, return feedback to the user with analysis, and recommend using [SVGOMG](mdc:https:/jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg) or similar optimization tools.
   * Ignore optimization or viewBox issues as they will be fixed by the build process. If the SVG is missing width and height attributes, add them. If the SVG is missing or have a different viewBox, update it to `0 0 16 16`.

## **Required Steps**
### 1. **File Creation**

* Create the new icon in the `packages/icons/src/assets` directory.

* Filename must:

  * Be lowercase
  * Use dashes (`-`) as separators
  * End with `.svg`

**Example:** `shopping-cart.svg`

* Final exported icon component name should use PascalCase with suffix "Icon":

  * Example: `ShoppingCartIcon`

### 2. **SVG Dimensions**
* Set explicit width and height attributes to exactly `16px` and viewBox to `0 0 16 16`:

```html
<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" ...>
```

### 3. **Changelog updates**

* Update the `packages/icons/CHANGELOG.md` file with the new icon.

### General Structure

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD `VERSION` (minor version bump from the previous version)

#### ðŸŽ‰ New features

- Adds `[icon-name]` icon. ([#PR_NUMBER](https://github.com/TiendaNube/nimbus-design-system/pull/PR_NUMBER) by [@NimbusAgent](https://github.com/NimbusAgent))
```

### 4. **Yarn versioning file**

* Run `yarn version --deferred decline` to create a new version file in `.yarn/versions` declining by default everything.
* Move the `@nimbus-ds/icons` package into the releases section with a minor version bump. Example:

```yml
releases:
  @nimbus-ds/icons: minor

declined: 
    nimbus-design-system
```

* ALWAYS decline the `nimbus-design-system` root package.
* Run `yarn bump:check` and check that there are no errors.

### 5. **Create a PR**
   - Commit using the format: `feat(icons): add [icon-name] icon`
   - Always create a branch from the latest `main`.
   - Push branch and open a PR titled: `feat: Add [icon-name] icon`.

## **Never Do the Following**
* Do not place icon files outside of `packages/icons/src/assets`.
* Do not omit `width` and `height` attributes.
* Do not use uppercase letters or underscores in filenames.
* Do not directly commit changes to `main`. Always use a dedicated branch FROM MAIN and open a PR.
