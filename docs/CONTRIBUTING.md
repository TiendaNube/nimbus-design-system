# 🙌 Contributing to Nimbus

First of all, **thank you** 🤜🏻💥🤛🏽 for taking the time to contribute to our project!

Here's how you can contribute to Nimbus:

## 🐛 Reporting a bug

Did you find a bug in one of our components? Please follow these steps:

- Make sure the bug was not already reported by searching on Github under [Issues](https://github.com/TiendaNube/nimbus-design-system/issues).
- If you were unable to find an issue reporting the bug, [create a new one](https://github.com/TiendaNube/nimbus-design-system/issues/new?assignees=juanchigallego%2C+diegopsilverio%2C+gabifagundes%2C+juniorconquista&labels=bug&template=BUG_REPORT.md&title=%5BNIMBUS%5D). Please fill out the template with all the required information to help us reproduce your issue.

## 🖌 Requesting a new component or feature

None of our components fulfill the needs of your application or feature? Is a component missing an important feature you need to develop your project? Not a problem! You can request a new component or feature by following these steps:

- First make sure there's actually _no way_ of achieving what you wish by using our existing components. You can verify all properties and features by browsing our [Storybook library](https://tiendanube.github.io/design-system-nimbus/).
- If there's no component to suit your needs, you can request a new one (or a new feature for an existing one) by opening an [Issue](https://github.com/TiendaNube/nimbus-design-system/issues/new?assignees=juanchigallego%2C+diegopsilverio%2C+gabifagundes%2C+juniorconquista&labels=enhancement&template=NEW_REQUEST.md&title=%5BREQUEST%5D). Please take the time to describe thoroughly **what** the component should do, **how** it should look (if you could provide sketches or benchmarks it would help us a lot), and **where** in your interface or product it would be used.

## 💻 Patching a bug

If you wrote a patch that fixes a bug in our [Issues](https://github.com/TiendaNube/nimbus-design-system/issues) directory, please:

- Open a [new Pull Request](https://github.com/TiendaNube/nimbus-design-system/compare) on Github with the patch.
- Ensure the description clearly addresses the issue and solution. Tag the issue number if applicable.
