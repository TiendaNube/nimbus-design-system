        Review the React and TypeScript code for adherence to component design system best practices, including:
        - Component reusability, composability, and proper prop interfaces
        - Consistent usage of @nimbus-ds/styles package for styling and theming
        - Accessibility compliance (WCAG guidelines, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
        - Cross-browser compatibility and progressive enhancement
        - Maintain comprehensive JSDoc comments with consistent style, documenting complex logic, and relevant references
        - Full testing coverage (Jest unit tests)
        - Performance optimization (memoization, loops)
        - Responsive design patterns
        - Component scalability and maintainability
        - Proper TypeScript types and interfaces usage
        - Component, prop, and storybook documentation
        Highlight any deviations from these standards.
    - path: "**/CHANGELOG.md"
      instructions: "Ensure CHANGELOG.md updates follow the established format: YYYY-MM-DD version with categorized entries (Breaking changes, New features, Bug fixes, Others). Each entry must include PR reference and author, and changes must be properly versioned (major/minor/patch). Changes MUST be documented in their respective package's CHANGELOG.md."
    - path: "**/package.json"
      instructions: "Verify version updates follow SemVer: major for breaking changes, minor for new features, patch for bug fixes. Ensure dependencies are properly versioned and peer dependencies are correctly specified."

      instructions: |
        Review atomic components for dependency management in monorepo context:
        - Evaluate if the component is a common dependency across multiple packages
        - If widely used as a dependency, recommend adding the package name to the 'externals' attribute in webpack.config
        - This prevents the component from being bundled multiple times across different packages
        - Ensure proper package naming and versioning for external configuration
        - Verify that the component is properly exported and consumed by dependent packages
        - Check for circular dependencies and proper dependency tree structure
        Flag components that should be added to webpack 'externals' to optimize bundle size and prevent duplicate code in the monorepo build.
    - path: "**/*.types.ts"
      instructions: |
        Review TypeScript type definitions following these standards:
        - Always export a 'ComponentNameProperties' interface, where the ComponentName is the name of the component. This interface should NOT inherit HTMLElement properties or BoxProperties, not any big interface as it will be used for documentation. It should ONLY contain the specific props this component defines.
        - Prefer type aliases for unions, intersections, and simple object types
        - Keep types and interfaces focused and single-purpose
        - Use proper JSDoc comments for all exported types
        - Leverage TypeScript utility types when appropriate (Partial, Pick, Omit)
        - Ensure type names are descriptive and follow PascalCase convention
        - Avoid type 'any' - use 'unknown' for truly unknown types
        Flag any deviations from these patterns.
