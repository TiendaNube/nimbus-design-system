        Review the React and TypeScript code for adherence to component design system best practices, including:
        - Component reusability, composability, and proper prop interfaces
        - Consistent usage of @nimbus-ds/styles package for styling and theming
        - Accessibility compliance (WCAG guidelines, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
        - Cross-browser compatibility and progressive enhancement
        - Maintain comprehensive JSDoc comments with consistent style, documenting complex logic, and relevant references
        - Full testing coverage (Jest unit tests)
        - Performance optimization (memoization, loops)
        - Responsive design patterns
        - Component scalability and maintainability
        - Proper TypeScript types and interfaces usage
        - Component, prop, and storybook documentation
        Highlight any deviations from these standards.
    - path: "**/CHANGELOG.md"
      instructions: |
        Ensure CHANGELOG.md updates follow the established format: YYYY-MM-DD version with categorized entries (Breaking changes, New features, Bug fixes, Others). 
        Each entry must include PR reference and author, and changes must be properly versioned (major/minor/patch). Changes MUST be documented in their respective package's CHANGELOG.md. 
        **CRITICAL: Clearly highlight and document the package bumps in the summary (or a comment, if unable), following exactly this structure: '@nimbus-ds/<package-name>@<bump-version>|<semver-type>: <Description>.' For example: '@nimbus-ds/styles@9.18.0|minor: Added scroll-pane new composite component...'. It is crucial to respect the requested structure.**
    - path: "**/package.json"
      instructions: "Verify version updates follow SemVer: major for breaking changes, minor for new features, patch for bug fixes. Ensure dependencies are properly versioned and peer dependencies are correctly specified."

      instructions: |
        Review atomic components for dependency management in monorepo context:
        - Evaluate if the component is a common dependency across multiple packages
        - If widely used as a dependency, recommend adding the package name to the 'externals' attribute in webpack.config
        - This prevents the component from being bundled multiple times across different packages
        - Ensure proper package naming and versioning for external configuration
        - Verify that the component is properly exported and consumed by dependent packages. **IMPORTANT** Constants declared within the package must be exported in order to be included in the final published build.
        - Check for circular dependencies and proper dependency tree structure
        Flag components that should be added to webpack 'externals' to optimize bundle size and prevent duplicate code in the monorepo build.
    - path: "**/*.types.ts"
      instructions: |
        Review TypeScript type definitions following these standards:
        - Always export a 'ComponentNameProperties' interface, where the ComponentName is the name of the component. This interface should NOT inherit HTMLElement properties or BoxProperties, not any big interface as it will be used for documentation. It should ONLY contain the specific props this component defines.
        - Prefer type aliases for unions, intersections, and simple object types
        - Keep types and interfaces focused and single-purpose
        - Use proper JSDoc comments for all exported types
        - Leverage TypeScript utility types when appropriate (Partial, Pick, Omit)
        - Ensure type names are descriptive and follow PascalCase convention
        - Avoid type 'any' - use 'unknown' for truly unknown types
        Flag any deviations from these patterns.

        mode: "error"
        instructions: |
          Pass/fail criteria: All breaking changes MUST have a MAJOR version bump (x.0.0) in package.json.
          
          Detect breaking changes by scanning for:
          1. **Props API changes** in *.types.ts: Removed props, renamed props, type narrowing (e.g., `string | number` → `string`), optional→required changes
          2. **Export removals** in index.ts: Any previously exported symbol (component, type, hook, utility) removed
          3. **Token changes** in packages/core/tokens/src/**/*.json: Removed or renamed token keys
          4. **Default value changes**: Changed defaultProps or default parameter values that alter behavior
          
          PASS if: No breaking changes detected, OR all breaking changes have corresponding MAJOR version bumps in package.json
          FAIL if: Breaking changes detected but package.json shows MINOR (0.x.0) or PATCH (0.0.x) bump, or no version bump at all
          
          When failing, list each breaking change found and the expected MAJOR version.
      - name: "Undocumented CSS Breaking Changes"
        mode: "error"
        instructions: |
          Pass/fail criteria: All CSS/styling breaking changes MUST be documented in CHANGELOG.md under "🛠 Breaking changes" section.
          
          Scan *.css.ts files (Vanilla-Extract) for:
          1. Removed exports: styleVariants, recipe, globalStyle, createVar removals
          2. Removed variant options from recipe() (e.g., size: { small, medium, large } → { small, medium })
          3. Renamed CSS class identifiers or CSS variables (--nimbus-*)
          4. Changed defaultVariants in recipe()
          5. Token reference changes (e.g., vars.colors.primary → vars.colors.brand)
          
          PASS if: No CSS breaking changes detected, OR all CSS breaking changes are documented in CHANGELOG.md with "🛠 Breaking changes" section
          FAIL if: CSS breaking changes found but CHANGELOG.md lacks documentation or "🛠 Breaking changes" section is missing
          
          CSS breaking changes are often overlooked - this check ensures they are properly documented for consumers.
      - name: "Breaking Change Documentation Verification"
        mode: "error"
        instructions: |
          Pass/fail criteria: If package.json has MAJOR version bump OR code contains breaking changes, CHANGELOG.md MUST have "#### 🛠 Breaking changes" section.
          
          Cross-reference:
          1. Check if any package.json in PR has MAJOR version bump (x.0.0)
          2. Check if breaking changes detected in code (props removed, exports removed, tokens changed, CSS modified)
          3. Verify CHANGELOG.md contains "#### 🛠 Breaking changes" or "### 🛠 Breaking changes" section
          4. Verify each breaking change is documented with description and PR reference
          
          PASS if: No breaking changes and no MAJOR bump, OR breaking changes exist with proper CHANGELOG documentation
          FAIL if: MAJOR bump without "🛠 Breaking changes" section, OR breaking changes in code without documentation
          
          Documentation format required: "- Description of breaking change. ([#PR](url) by [@author](url))"
